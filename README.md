# NY-Citibike-with-Tableau by Kieran Persaud

## Overview of the Tableau Challenge
In this Challenge, we want to establish a Bikeshare business for Des Moines, Iowa. To best understand the business model, we first analyze Citi Bike data from New York using Tableau. In the module, we created several visualizations to hone our Tableau skills. Now for the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis, and we are tasked with creating five new visualizations.

## Resources
